# Linkastor

Linkastor is an opensource curation web app inspired by [Linkydink](http://linkydink.io/) with few improuvments (on the way).

It's meant to be self hosted (Instructions will came when it will make sense).

## Feature roadmap 

Few things we already though about :
- Social login (Twitter? Facebook?)
- Comments thread for every post -> the ability to reply/react on a posted link was one of the big things missing on Linkydink for us
- Social sharing, send to pocket...
- Search Feature (Algolia?)
- The ability to choose the right time/frequence for the digest (Linkydink don't send anything on Friday/Week-end so you end up with a lot things to read on Monday and probably not time for it until the next Week-end)
- Chrome extension
- Mobile app/extension?
- Input via email
